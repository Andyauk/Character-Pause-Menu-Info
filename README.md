Hi!

First of all, this script needs ESX to work.

I made this script (ch_pause_menu) this morning, "The simplest script to change pause menu information."
With this script you can add a title and a subtitle text in the pause menu of Fivem, and it also shows the character's name instead of the Steam account and the bank money and cash!
You can change the cash and bank text in the `config.lua` file, of course. This script is free and can be downloaded from my github page and modified and distributed in any way you want.

I have added this script to my tebex page, which right now does not have any packages, only entities. In the future I intend to add several scripts, some of which will be paid. You can "buy" this script from my tebex page, but it is not necessary. That "purchase" is more of a "donation" and I make it clear on the tebex page and here. It is not necessary to pay to use the script, whoever wants to can contribute by buying it, but it is not necessary.

The Tebex package link: [https://chicle.tebex.io/package/4577812](https://chicle.tebex.io/package/4577812)

The download link: https://github.com/Eschiclers/ch_pause_menu/archive/refs/tags/1.0.1.zip

Installation is REALLY simple. Just drag the folder to your resources folder and add it to the server.cfg.

Thank you for your attention and I will read the responses and private messages if anyone needs help, has any questions or has any suggestions.

Have a great day! ♥
